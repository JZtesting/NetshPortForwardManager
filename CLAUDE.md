## Previous Major Changes (2024-12-25)

### Architecture Transformation
1. **Model Separation**: Split single `Server` class into:
   - `AgentServer`: Servers running PortProxy agent (executors)
   - `TargetServer`: Destination servers (targets for forwarding)
   - Maintained legacy `Server` class for backward compatibility

2. **Enhanced Rule Model**: Extended `PortForwardRule` with:
   - `Description` (required): Clear rule purpose description
   - `Category`: Web, Database, Admin, API, Monitoring
   - `Tags`: Flexible labeling system
   - `AgentServerId`: Which agent executes the rule
   - `TargetServerId`: Which server to forward to
   - Color-coded category badges

3. **Service Layer Rewrite**: Completely rewrote `ServerService`:
   - Dual collections: `AgentServers` and `TargetServers`
   - Separate JSON persistence files
   - Automatic migration from legacy `servers.json`
   - Backward compatibility methods marked as obsolete

4. **UI Architecture Updates**:
   - `MainViewModel`: Updated for agent/target separation
   - TreeView: Now displays `AgentServers` with connection status
   - `Silo` model: Supports both legacy and new server types
   - Server selection: Filters rules by selected agent server

5. **Rule Metadata Persistence** (NEW - 2025-06-25):
   - `RuleMetadataService`: Complete metadata persistence system
   - JSON-based storage in `rule_metadata.json`
   - Unique key generation using `{AgentId}:{ListenAddress}:{ListenPort}`
   - Automatic metadata application to loaded rules
   - Robust cleanup prevention during parsing failures
   - Enhanced edit workflow with metadata protection

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing code continues to work with legacy `Server` class
- Automatic migration converts existing servers to agent servers
- Legacy methods available with obsolete warnings
- Existing JSON configurations automatically upgraded

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Agent service not yet implemented (Phase 2)
- No encrypted communication protocol
- No rule templates or bulk operations
- Limited search and filtering capabilities
- Background health monitoring not implemented
- Automatic failover logic not implemented

### Technical Debt
- Need comprehensive logging system
- Agent deployment and update mechanism
- Memory management for DNS cache
- Thread safety for concurrent agent operations
- Error handling for agent communication failures
- Legacy compatibility warnings need to be addressed in future versions

## Build & Deployment

### Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- .NET 6.0 Runtime
- Administrator privileges (for netsh commands)

### Build Commands
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run  # Requires Administrator
```

### Configuration Files
- Rules: JSON export/import format (enhanced with descriptions and server associations)
- AgentServers: JSON configuration with URLs and keys (agentservers.json)
- TargetServers: JSON configuration with DNS names and descriptions (targetservers.json)
- Silos: JSON configuration with agent server associations (silos.json)
- Settings: Application preferences and encryption settings
- Legacy Migration: Automatic migration from servers.json to agentservers.json

### Agent Deployment
- PortProxyAgent.msi: Windows Installer package
- HTTP endpoint on configurable port (default 8080)
- Auto-generated encryption keys
- Windows Service registration

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing MVVM patterns
- Use modern C# features (.NET 6)
- Maintain WPF best practices
- Add XML documentation for public APIs

### UI Guidelines
- Maintain material design principles
- Use established color scheme and typography
- Ensure accessibility standards
- Support keyboard navigation
